**Welcome!** This project is a simple template that I created to kickstart my journey with React Native and Expo. It's the starting point of many more projects to come, and I look forward to reflecting back on this after gaining a few years of experience as a developer. The only way from here is up!

## About This Project

This template serves as my entry into mobile app development using React Native and Expo. It doesn't include any advanced features yet, but represents the beginning of my journey in software development.

## My Setup Journey

Getting this Expo project up and running was an exciting challenge and a valuable learning experience. Here are the steps I took:

1. **Getting Comfortable with the Command Line**
    - This project marked my first real dive into using the command line. At first, it was overwhelming, but through practice, I became more comfortable navigating through directories and executing commands.

2. **Installing Prerequisites**
    - **Node.js**: I installed Node.js from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/), which is essential for running JavaScript outside the browser and managing packages.
    - **Expo CLI**: I globally installed Expo CLI using npm. This required a few attempts to ensure that global installs and permissions were correctly configured:
      ```bash
      npm install -g expo-cli
      ```

3. **Setting Environment Variables**
    - Ensuring my system had the right environment variables set up correctly was necessary. This step involved configuring paths for various tools I installed.

4. **Overcoming Hurdles**
    - Setting up my development environment involved troubleshooting a few issues with global installs and system pathways. I learned to check and adjust environment variables, which was a rewarding hurdle to overcome.

5. **Running My First Application**
    - Once everything was set up, I was able to run my first Expo project smoothly:
      ```bash
      expo start
      ```
    - I then used the Expo Go app on my device to see my project come to life by scanning the QR code.

## Future Plans

This project marks the beginning of my development path. I aim to gradually add more features, explore new technologies, and contribute to real-world applications through future projects.
